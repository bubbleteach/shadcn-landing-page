            This Usage Policy is calibrated to strike an optimal balance between
            enabling beneficial uses and mitigating potential harms. GrimoAI may
            enter into contracts with certain governmental customers that tailor

            authorities if, in GrimoAI’s judgment, the contractual use
            restrictions and applicable safeguards are adequate to mitigate the
            potential harms addressed by this Usage Policy.
