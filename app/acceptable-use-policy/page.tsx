              Human-in-the-loop: when using our products or services to provide
              advice, recommendations, or subjective decisions that directly
              impact individuals in high-risk domains, a qualified professional
              in that field must review the content or decision prior to
              dissemination or finalization. This requirement applies
              specifically to content or decisions that are provided to
              consumers or the general public, or decisions made about an
              individual. Your business is responsible for the accuracy and
              appropriateness of that information. For other types of content
              generation or interactions with users that do not involve direct
              advice, recommendations, or subjective decisions, human review is
              strongly encouraged but not mandatory.
