# üìù The Hidden Power of Documents in Task Management

After years of exploring various task management tools, I've come to a realization that I want to share with my network: We've been looking at documents all wrong.

Many dismiss document tools as "just another note-taking solution." But what if I told you that documents could be one of the most powerful interfaces for task management?

Here's what I've learned while building Bento, a tool that reimagines how we interact with documents:

1. The Power of Flexibility

- No forced structures or rigid time formats

- Natural task capture in the flow of work

- Freedom to be as detailed or brief as needed

2. Context is Everything

- Tasks naturally stay connected to their origin
- Meeting notes and action items live together
- Rich annotations provide complete understanding

3. The Integration Challenge

I found myself bouncing between Raycast's mobility and Logseq's organization. This led to creating Bento - combining floating windows for quick capture with the power of local markdown files.

üîë Key Insight: The best task management system is one that adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

The Future of Task Management:
- Open data formats for better tool interoperability
- Focus on capture speed and context preservation
- Flexible systems that grow with your needs

I've detailed this journey and the practical implications in my latest article. It's not just about task management - it's about rethinking how we interact with our tools.

Would love to hear from others who've experimented with different approaches to task management. What's working for you? What's missing from current solutions?
